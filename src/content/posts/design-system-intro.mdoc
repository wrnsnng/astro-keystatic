# Introduction to Our Design System

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled to build any number of applications. Our design system helps ensure consistency across our products while accelerating the development process.

## Core Principles

Our design system is built on these foundational principles:

### 1. Consistency

Consistency creates familiarity and reduces cognitive load for users. Our design system ensures that similar components behave in similar ways across all our products.

### 2. Accessibility

We design with accessibility in mind from the start. Our components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and work well with assistive technologies.

### 3. Efficiency

Our design system accelerates development by providing ready-to-use components that integrate seamlessly with each other.

### 4. Scalability

The system is designed to grow and evolve as our products expand, with a focus on maintaining backward compatibility.

## Getting Started

If you're new to our design system, we recommend starting with these resources:

- Explore the [Component Library](/components)
- Learn about our design tokens and principles
- Check out example implementations

## Benefits for Developers

For developers, our design system offers:

- Reduced decision fatigue
- Faster implementation time
- Built-in accessibility features
- Thoroughly tested components
- Comprehensive documentation
